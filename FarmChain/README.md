1. **Frontend (Vue.js):**
   - The `frontend` folder contains the Vue.js application responsible for the user interface.

2. **Backend (Python - Flask):**
   - The `backend` folder contains the Flask-based backend API that serves as the intermediary between the front end and the smart contracts.

3. **Smart Contracts (Rust):**
   - The `smart_contracts` folder contains the Rust smart contracts used to manage product data on the blockchain.
